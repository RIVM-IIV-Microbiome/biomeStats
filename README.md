_biomestats_ is an R package developed to bring the microbiome association framework proposed by Ferreira JA and Fuentes S. [Some comments on certain statistical aspects of the study of the microbiome. Briefings in bioinformatics. 2020 Jul;21(4):1487-94](https://doi.org/10.1093/bib/bbz077) to the wider microbiome research community. The tools is developed within the RIVM-Microbiome Toolbox project.    

The [biomestats](https://github.com/microsud/biomestats) R package currently supports cross-sectional associations and does not incorporate methods for longitudinal observations.
